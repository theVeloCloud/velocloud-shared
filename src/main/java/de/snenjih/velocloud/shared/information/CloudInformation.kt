 * Represents immutable system information about a cloud instance at a specific point in time.

 *
 * @property started The timestamp (epoch millis) when the cloud instance was started.
 * @property runtime The human-readable runtime version or identifier of the cloud instance.
 * @property javaVersion The Java version used by the cloud runtime.
 * @property cpuUsage The current CPU usage percentage.
 * @property usedMemory The currently used heap memory in megabytes.
 * @property maxMemory The maximum available heap memory in megabytes.
 * @property subscribedEvents The number of events currently subscribed by the cloud instance.
 * @property timestamp The timestamp (epoch millis) when this snapshot was captured.
